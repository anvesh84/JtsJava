static methods : These are the methods that which are to be called by using class name.
You cannot call them by using instance of the class. 

static variables : These are the variables that which retains values, irrespective of type of object. 

Inheritance : The concept of deriving a new class from already existing class known as inheritance, the class which is derived known as derived class, the class from which it is derived known as base class. Through inheritance, we can reduce the size of the program. 

class First {
....
....
....
}

class Second extends First {
....
....
....
}

Once you create an object to Second class, then you can access all public/protected and friendly members of the base class. 


super : If you want to pass values from derived class to base class, then we need the help of super keyword. It has 2 forms as 


	(i) super as a keyword 
       (ii) super as a constuctor 


Abstract Class : A class that which can be created, but not implemented and instantiated known as abstract class. Abstract class contains both abstract and non-abstract methods, only abstract methods needs to be overrided mandetorily by the derived class. 

interfaces : Java does not support the concept of multiple inheritance, to achieve this we need the help of interfaces. An interface contains method declaration and the implementation can be done in the corresponding class. You can add more than one interface to the particular class. 

Differences between interface and abstract class : 
___________________________________________________

	-> An abstract class contains both abstract and non-abstract methods, where interface contains only abstract methods.

	-> interface methods are public and abstract by default. 

	-> Multiple inheritance can be achieved by using interfaces. 

	-> An interface can be called from anywhere to anywhere.
