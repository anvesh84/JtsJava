Access Modifiers :
___________________


There are 4 access modifiers we have as 

	1) private : Allows you to access members within the current class. 

	2) public  : Allows you to access members in entire application. 

	3) protected : Allows you to access members within current/derived classes. 

	4) friendly : By default, java possess friendly access modifier, allows you to access
		members in all classes of current package. 

Data Types : 
______________

There are 2 types of data types as 

	(i) value types : int, float, double, char, boolean 

	(ii) reference type : String, Object 

System.out.println() : Used to display any value or message. 

	System -> class

	out -> Console

	println() -> Method.


System.out.println("Welcome to Java Programming...");

int a;
double b;
String name;

System.out.println("A value is " +a+ " B value is " +b+ " Name is " +name);


You can create an object to the class, as 

class_name obj = new class_name();

Control Structures : 
____________________

Used to define the flow of the program. 

There are 2 types of control structures known as 

	1) branching control structures 

		if...else : Executes statements based on the condition. 

		if (condition) {
			statement(s);
		} else {
			statement(s);
		}

	2) looping control structures 

	while loop : This loop executes all the statements repeatedly until the condition remains true,
		if the condition remains false, then it comes out of the loop. For every loop, basically there are 
		3 phases as 

			(i) Initialization

			(ii) Condition

			(iii) Increment/Decrement 


		*** Initialization performed at the beginning of the loop ***
		*** Condition performed at the conditinal part of the loop ***
		*** Increment/Decrement performed before closing the loop ***


		while(condition) {
			statement(s);
		}
