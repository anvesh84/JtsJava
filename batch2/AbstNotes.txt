Abstract Class : 

A class that which can be created, but not implemented and instantiated known as abstract class. 

Abstract class contains both abstract and non-abstract methods, abstract methods 
needs to be overrided mandetorily by the derived class. 

interface : Java does not support the concept of multiple inheritance, to achieve this
we need the help of interfaces. An interface contains method declaration and the implementation
can be done in the correponding class, you can add more than one interface to the particular class. 


Difference between interface and abstract class 
_________________________________________________

	-> An abstract class contains both abstract/non-abstract methods, where
			interface contains only abstract methods.

	-> interface methods are public and abstract by default. 

	-> Multiple Inheritance can be achieved by using interfaces. 

	-> An interface can be called from anywhere to anywhere.
