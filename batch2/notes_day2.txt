Control Structures : 
_____________________

Used to define the flow of the program. 

There are 2 types of control structures known as 

	(i) Branching

	(ii) Looping 



if...else : Executes the statements based on the condition. 

	if (condition) {
	   statement(s);
	} else {
	   statement(s);
	}


while loop : This loop executes all the statements repeatedly until condition remains true, 
if the condition remains false, then it comes out of the loop. For every loop, basically, there 
are 3 phases as 

	(i) Initialization

	(ii) Condition 

	(iii) Increment/Decrement 


Initialization performed at the beginning of the loop. 

Condition performed at the conditional part of the loop.

Increment/Decrement performed before closing the loop.


for loop : This loop executes all the statements repeatedly until the condition remains true,
if the condition remains false, then it comes out of the loop. 

for(initialization;condition;increment/decrement) {
....
....
....
}

6  -> 1, 2, 3 

	 6


switch...case : Used to define any menu driven programs. 

	switch(choice) {
	
		case expr1 : 
			 statement(s);
			 break;
		case expr2 : 
			 statement(s);
			 break;
		...	
		...
		...
		default :
		   statement(s);
		   break;
	}		


Arrays : An array is the finite ordered set of homogeneous elements, means all the elements belongs 
to same data type. 

All the elements of the array are to be stored in successive memory locations. 

int[] a = new int[]{12,4,66,23,8};

a[0]=12;
a[1]=4;
a[2]=66;
a[3]=23;
a[4]=8;

int[] a = new int[] {12,88,42,32,90};
for (int i : a) {
   System.out.println(i);
}

Internal execution of foreach loop : 
_______________________________________

In this, at first i points to the first element in array A, after processing first element, it 
checks whether next element is there or not by using hasNext(), if hasNext() returns true, 
then it moves to the next element by using next(), it repeats as soon as hasNext() return false. 


String (vs) StringBuilder : 

Strings are immutable, means once they are assigned they cannot be changed.
