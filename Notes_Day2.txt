for loop : This loop executes all the statements repeatedly until the condition remains true, if the condition remains false, then it comes out of the loop. 

for(initialization;condition;increment/decrement) {
  statement(s);
}


Perfect Number : 

6  -> 1, 2, 3 

	6

switch...case : Used to implement menu-driven programs. 

Array : An array is the finite ordered set of homogeneous elements, means all the elements belongs to same data type. All the elements of array are stored in successive memory locations. 

int[] a = new int[]{10,20,30,40} means 

a[0]=10;
a[1]=20;
a[2]=30;
a[3]=40;


int[] a = new int[] {5,33,67,9,62};
for (int i : a) {
   System.out.println(i);
}

In the above loop, at first i points to the first element in array a. 

after processing first element, it checks whether next element is there or not by using 
hasNext(), if hasNext() returns true, then it moves to the next element by using next(). 
if hasNext() returns false, then it comes out of the loop. 

Strings are reference types and they are immutable. 

Exercises : 
____________

1) Program to display a number in words upto 1 to 9999
ex : enter as 426 then print as FOUR Hundred Twenty Six
        1234 One Thousand Two Hundred Thirty Four 

2) Program to Print a number in rowman format. 

3) 

Write a program to read no.of units and generate current bill. 

Assume, you consume 270 units then, 

first 90 units 1rs per unit

91 to 150 units its 1.5 rs 

151 to 200 units its 2rs 

201 to 240 units its 2.5 rs

240+ its 3rs 


(90*1) + (60*1.5) + (50 * 2) + (40 * 2.5) + 30 * 3 

There are 2 types of memories as 

	1) STACK

	2) HEAP 

Value types will be stored in STACK memory and reference types will be stored in HEAP memory. 

enum : Used to store group of constants.
